# ClaimReclaim 🏥🤖

**Healthcare Insurance Resolution Agent Dashboard**

> 🏆 Built for the [Hackathon Name] Hackathon

ClaimReclaim is a real-time command center for healthcare staff to monitor AI agents as they autonomously negotiate insurance claims. It transforms the tedious, hours-long process of waiting on hold and arguing for pre-authorizations into a streamlined, visual workflow.
