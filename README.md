# ClaimReclaim 🏥

**The AI Agent for Healthcare Insurance Resolution**

> 🏆 **[11 LABS GLOBAL HACKATHON - WARSAW] Entry**

## 💡 The Problem
Healthcare providers spend **hours every day** on hold with insurance companies, fighting for pre-authorizations and claim approvals. It's a manual, frustrating, and expensive process that delays patient care and burns out staff.

## 🤖 The Solution
**ClaimReclaim** is an autonomous AI agent that handles these calls for you.

This repository contains the dashboard for ClaimReclaim, a real-time command center where administrative staff can:
*   **Monitor** the AI as it talks to insurance representatives.
*   **Visualize** live claim statuses and transcripts.
*   **Review** documents and denial reasons instantly.

Instead of sitting on hold, staff can manage a dashboard of active agents working in parallel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
